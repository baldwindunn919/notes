- "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth. 

This quote reminds us that optimizing code too early in the development process can lead to unnecessary complexity, harder maintenance, and potential bugs. It's better to write clear and simple code first, then optimize only when necessary, based on profiling and measurement.
